# russian-state-duma-sessions

Analysis of the transcripts of the Russian State Duma collected from the official website http://transcript.duma.gov.ru/.

In 2020, I collected the transcripts using R for my university course on computational methods of text analysis.

In 2021, an independent group of researchers collected the same data which was published with open access at [Discuss Data repository](https://www.discuss-data.net/dataset/fb52dac2-66e3-47a3-86c5-b2a3dadf41bf/). I'm going to enrich my data by using this source as well.
